{- TODO consider doubling and leaving out notes when working with a limited set of
   pitches and voices.

   For example in a 3-note chord such as dm, an full voicing should contain
   at least one number n satisfying 3n+0, one satisfying 3n+1 and one 3n+2.
   In classical harmony out the firth (3n+2) is sometimes acceptable.
   TODO invertVoicing preserves such "complete" voicings.

    [0,1,2,3] (closed) is good
    [0,3,5,6] is bad because we're missing the 3rd: there's no 3n+1

--
-- * Dissonant notes (relative the root) in a dominanth chords (e.g. 7th, 9th)
--   are resolved downwards.
--
-- * Leading tone resolves upwards
